Thank you for checking out my project.

To play the game, launch "cardgame.exe". This is the actual game file.

This is a project that utilizes course material from Texas A&M's Data Structures and Algorithms course
to showcase what I have learned.

Description:
Created a terminal-based poker simulation utilizing C++ with ASCII-based user interface.

Implemented object-oriented programming principles, including the Rule of Three, dynamic memory allocation, and batch processing.


Made by Brandon Perez. 

I hope you enjoy playing!
